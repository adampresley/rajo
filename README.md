RAJO
====

*Random Assortment of JavaScript Objects*

## Building
To build a minified version and documentation you must have NodeJS + NPM + Grunt installed. Once
installed you can follow these commands to build.

```bash
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

This will generate a combined, minified JavaScript file in **dist/rajo.js** as well
as the library documentation in **dist/docs/html**.
